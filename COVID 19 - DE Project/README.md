This project showcases an end-to-end COVID-19 data engineering pipeline implemented using AWS services and Python. The goal is to extract, process, and load COVID-19 data from AWS COVID-19 data lake for analysis and reporting purposes.

### Project Highlights:<br>
* **AWS Integration**: Utilized AWS Glue, Athena, and S3 to seamlessly extract, transform, and load COVID-19 data.<br>
* **Data Processing**: Leveraged the power of Pandas for data manipulation, merging, and transformation, ensuring data integrity and quality.<br>
* **Scalable Data Warehousing**: Integrated Amazon Redshift for efficient data storage and analysis, enabling scalable and performant querying of the COVID-19 dataset.
